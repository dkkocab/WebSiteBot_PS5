# WebSiteBot_PS5
This is a bot that will buy a PS5 through Walmart. It's written in python and uses selenium to interact with web pages. It's a very simple program that uses recursion to prevent the code from crashing from running faster than the webpage. There's no promise it'll work everytime though. If the site crashes, the code will stop. There's currently only a bot for Walmart's PS5 physical and digital edition. 

## Installment
I decided to remove the release. Please just run the code on an IDE of your choice as I try to improve the program
