# WebSiteBot_PS5
This is a bot that will buy a PS5 through Walmart. It's written in python and uses selenium to interact with web pages. It's a very simple program that uses recursion to prevent the code from crashing from running faster than the webpage. There's no promise it'll work everytime though. If the site crashes, the code will stop. There's currently only a bot for Walmart's PS5 disc edition. 

## Installment
Download the WalmartBot.exe and run it. Your window's computer will say it's a dangerous file but I promise you, there's nothing mischeavous in it. Once installed, it'll give you a folder with a WalmartBot.exe. Run the executable and the bot will begin.
